# Data-Modeling
This repository contains resources and discussion regarding the JDX ([Job Data Exchange](https://jobdataexchange.io/)) JobSchema+ RDF model including: RDF Schema definitions of properties and classes; SKOS definitions of relevant concept schemes for some of the properties; and a JSON-LD context.

The full data model is in the JS+_Full directory. A subset of the data model which was piloted with employer partners as part of the JDX project is in the JS+_releases/v0.9.0-piloted-version folder. Some corrections have since been made to the full data model that have not been made to the piloted version.
